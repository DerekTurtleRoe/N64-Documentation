VMOV is incorrectly documented:
The source index is not an element number, it uses the same indexing scheme as vector ops

Use my Transpose Matrix VMOV demo here to make sure you have implemented VMOV correctly:
https://github.com/PeterLemon/N64/tree/master/RSPTest/CP2/LOADSTORE/TransposeMatrixVMOV

cen64 has a working VMOV implementation

Question: I don't really get how VMOV is supposed to work...
krom's RSP errata docs say it should use the same scheme as vector ops
 
Aphex Twin
Answer: the low accumulator is set to vt
and the chosen element of vd is set to the chosen element of vt
 
Aphex Twin
src = switch (e) {
    case 0..1: de & 0x7
    case 2..3: (e & 0x1) | (de & 0x6)
    case 4..7: (e & 0x3) | (de & 0x4)
    case 8..15: e & 0x7
}

vector[vd][de & 0x7] = vector[vt][src]
accum_lo = vector[vt]

VSAR is incorrectly documented:
It says VSAR writes to the accumulator & it does not.

@krom you're collecting n64 errata right?
Not sure this counts but a lot of sources seem to indicate that the CIC on the cart sources the 1.9MHz clock on pin 19 to the PIF,
rather than the other way around (which is correct)

krom
ah nice one, I'll add that...
 
awygle
I should mention my source for the claim that the PIF sources it is "stuck an oscilloscope into my n64" so my confidence is high
 
krom
ah heh!

SWV - Ultra64 documentation says 0x07 for opcode, it should be 0x0A

VRSQ is documented as copying VT to ACC_L, but it actually copies VT[e] to ACC_L

I have found another error in the n64 rsp documents with the vmacq opcode.
So when it tests for zero it only does it on the acc[47:21] bits only. Not the whole number. The cheat sheet in it says the whole number is tested
