# Chinese cartridges

Not much is known about Chinese carts other then that they exist and there are several games that were sold like this (whether or not they are official is up for debate currently).

It is a NTSC ROM and PCB with a Japanese shell and a Chinese label put on the back.

Some images of currently known to exist carts are included in the subdirectory.
