# Case scans
Much like the cart scans, these aren't named/labelled, and this is only NTSC and possibly some PAL carts. I don't recall where these were downloaded, I had them in a folder called "N64cases" and the only info I could get from any of them was that I downloaded them in early 2016. I don't have any cases for any of my own games, so this is all I've been able to dig up at the moment. I also don't have a "professional" camera, so it'd be smartphone pictures if I did. Not an ideal situation is what I'm saying. I also don't own a decent scanner, so I'd have to get them all scanned at my local print place and that'd be time consuming and expensive (for me). But if I ever get any cases I'd be willing to do any of the work necessary to get them scanned and preserved in very high resolution and with as close to no visual issues.
