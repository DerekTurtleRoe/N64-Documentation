# Game Pak

*The Nintendo 64 Game Pak (part number NUS-006) is the brand name of the consumer ROM cartridge product that stores game data for the Nintendo 64, released in 1996. As with Nintendo's previous consoles, the Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximum system speed and minimal base console costâ€”with less storage space and a higher unit cost per game. Integrating a CD-ROM drive, with its expensive and moving parts, would have drastically increased the console's base price and reduced its performance.*

**While the use of the Read and Write contacts seems obvious, it's actually not 100% confirmed.**
