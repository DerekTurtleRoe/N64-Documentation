## Nintendo 64 emulators

Project Unreality, released on February 27, 1998, was the first Nintendo 64 emulator that could run several homebrew ROMs and could show the Nintendo 64 logo screen of Mortal Kombat Trilogy and Wave Race 64. It was discontinued after the two main developers decided to join a game development company to create commercial Nintendo 64 games.

UltraHLE, released on January 28, 1999, was so good that it angered Nintendo. The source code to this emulator was leaked, and shortly thereafter it was cancelled and never touched again.

Nemu64, released on December 11, 1998, was one of the first Nintendo 64 emulators that used a plugin system that is still used by Project64 and was used in early versions of Mupen64Plus. It is also known for its extensive debug features which most emulators lack.

Project64 was released on May 26, 2001.

Mupen64, the base to Mupen64Plus, was released December 10, 2001 by Hacktarux. On August 26, 2005, Mupen64 version 0.5 was released. It was the last version of Mupen64 by Hacktarux.

Mupen64Plus's oldest release I could find was 1.3 release candidate 1 on Mar 23, 2008. In October 2007, Mupen64 was forked by Richard Goedeken (richard42). His work went through several releases before settling on the name Mupen64Plus. The original repo has an original create date of Mar 19, 2008.

Sixtyforce is a Mac-exclusive emulator developed by Gerrit Goossen.
